<h1>About Us</h1>
<p>As a nation, we have been steadily improving and increasing the number of women who choose to pursue STEM fields. Averaged over the last 40 years, 42% of all STEM degrees went to women. However, women only make up 27% of the STEM workforce. Not only this, but an average woman working in STEM makes about 14% less than a man working in a similar position.
</p><p>
We are in need of a resource for women in STEM to connect with each other and to awesome opportunities in STEM. This is where WISE Up comes into play. WISE Up is an initiative designed to keep Women in Science and Engineering in contact with each other, to not only get women interested in STEM but to retain them.
</p><p>
Our methods are simple: Prospective mentors can share their basic contact and employment information along with their location and general fields of study. These mentors are the ones who have research and job opportunities for prospective mentees. Mentees will be able to browse the list of mentors and can access their contact information through our website!
</p><p>
Through our program, we hope to create an expansive and supportive WISE network, and for women around the country to have a valuable resource for STEM opportunities.</p>
